      <h1>Rails 3, Mongoid, And State Machine</h1>
      <p>[UPDATE] Ryan the author of stateflow has updated the library to work with Rails 2.3.x and Rails 3 you no longer need to modify anything to get it working with Rails 3. [/UPDATE]</p>
<p>It is amazing that we have had a blog for about 9 months and I have only posted 1 blog post. I am going to try and make a point to change that and start posting some more about what I am working on, what goodies I am using, and anything that might be useful to someone else or myself later down the road. So Rails 3 is out and it is great. I upgraded our site to a release candidate of it a week or so ago and everything went well with that, but I will talk about that in another post. Along with upgrading our site to Rails 3 I also changed from MongoMapper to MongoID. I think that they are both great libraries, but there were some things that just flowed better for me personally with MongoID.</p>
<p>Right now I am working on a project that I have a need for a state machine library. I googled and found <a href="http://github.com/ryanza/stateflow/" title="stateflow">stateflow</a>. Stateflow supports MongoID as a persistence layer. <del>I only needed to modify the persistence file for MongoID to adjust the callback for Rails 3 since the :before_validation_on_create has changed</del></p>

<p>So far in my small initial tests all seems to be working fine for me. I will post back if I run into anything that isn’t working for me.</p>
