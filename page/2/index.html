      <h1><a href="/2010/01/08/mongodb-and-mongomapper-greatness">MongoDB And MongoMapper Greatness</a></h1>
      
      <p>I was so excited to get a blog up and running and I haven’t even posted on it yet. So here goes nothing. I have been reading about document-oriented databases for a little while, but never really dug into it too far. It just so happens that <a href="http://railscasts.com/" title="Railscasts">Railscasts</a> did a segment on <a href="http://mongodb.org/" title="MongoDB">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/" title="MongoMapper">MongoMapper</a> so this was the perfect time to look into it a little more. I must say that John Nunemaker and anyone else that has worked on MongoMapper is doing a great job because it was pretty easy for me to convert our very own zyphmartin.com site over from PostgreSQL to MongoDB. Keep in mind that I do not consider myself a SQL guru to begin with so I am quite excited and impressed with MongoDB and MongoMapper.</p>
<p>Setting up the connection was very straight forward just as the Railscast shows:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># initializers/mongo_config.rb</span>
<span class="co"># Set Logger</span>
<span class="dt">MongoMapper</span>.connection = <span class="dt">Mongo</span>::<span class="dt">Connection</span>.new(<span class="st">'localhost'</span>, <span class="dv">27017</span>, <span class="st">:logger</span> =&gt; <span class="dt">Rails</span>.logger)
 
<span class="co"># Database</span>
<span class="dt">MongoMapper</span>.database = <span class="st">&quot;zm-</span><span class="ot">#{</span><span class="dt">Rails</span>.env<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>

<span class="co"># Authentication</span>
<span class="dt">MongoMapper</span>.database.authenticate(<span class="st">'user'</span>, <span class="st">'password'</span>)</code></pre>
<p>That is it to get up and running and you technically don’t need to set the logger or authentication to get a base minimum setup going. I ended up setting the logger originally because I was using a modified version of <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/" title="Paperclip">Paperclip</a> but I ended up switching to <a href="http://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/" title="Carrierwave">Carrierwave</a> since it works out of the box with MongoMapper. Another reason I choose Carrierwave was because I am able to save to file as I did with Paperclip or I can save to Mongo’s GridFS.</p>
<p>I also opted out of <a href="http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/" title="Thinking Sphinx">Thinking Sphinx</a> which is what I was using for the search on the site but I thought that is was a little heavy for what we needed so I went to a simple mongo query. I will be adding more blog posts about MongoMapper down the road. Most everything else worked fine without much change. Here is a list of some great articles and places that I found the info that I needed.</p>
